Blast gates can be equipped with low voltage magnetic reed switches (alarm switches) that can be used to turn on the dust collector. They could also be used to turn off power to machines whose blast gates are closed.

[Loc-Line](https://www.loc-line.com/products/2-5-vacuum-hose/) - hose system for dust collection where it is difficult, or not worth the time, to set up a "permanent" system - e.g., drill presses. Anti-static hose and fittings are available. Lee Valley stocks a [limited selection](http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?cat=1,42401,62604&p=58751) of the non-anti-static components.
