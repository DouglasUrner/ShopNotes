# Sliding Dovetails & Tapered Sliding Dovetails

General considerations:

* Large diameter of the bit - must be less than the width of the sides (the tails or the male part).
* Bit angle - common advice is to use a small angle (e.g., 7°) for hardwood and a larger angle (e.g., 14°) for softwood. A small angle bit also leaves a stouter neck on the tail.
* Taper for sliding dovetail - roughly 1:100

For anything that can be handled on the router table, that is the way to go since the joint can be cut using the same height setting on the table.

## Bits

[Whiteside K33 (Keller 1633)](https://www.whitesiderouterbits.com/products/K33) - 7°, 7/16" (11.11 mm) LD, 3/4" (19.05 mm) DOC. No need for the bearing, but it is not in the way. At an 8 mm DOC the top width of the pin is about 10 mm.

[Whiteside RD2100](https://www.whitesiderouterbits.com/collections/down-cut-spirals/products/rd2100) - 1/4" LD, 1" DOC downcut spiral for wasting the center of the pins before cutting the actual dovetail. The diameter has to be selected to be no larger than the narrowest (top) width of the pin.

## Jigs & Methods

Start by flattening stock and planning all of the tail boards to *exactly* the same thickness if the tails are being cut on a router table since the final size of the tails is determined by the amount of material cut away.

The pins can (should) be cut on the router table if the pieces are managable. For case ends and other parts that are too unwieldly to machine on a router table, a dado jig is used.

For tapered joints one side can be square (untapered) with all of the taper on the other side - so an adjustable dado jig could be used. But you would have to be very careful to keep track of where the taper is to avoid mistakes.

Cut tails on a router table using a feather board and a tall auxillary fence to ensure that the cuts are consistant.

The pins on stopped sliding dovetails can be cut by plunging or breaching (?) the cutter - as long as the cutter is smaller in diameter than the width of the tail board the holes left will be hidden. If the cut on the pin boards is stopped about one cutter diameter from the end then the tails can be trimmed on the same setup.
