## Bandsaw Set Up

1. If using a riser block - clean / remove paint from the faces of the riser block and the frame halves.
1. Assemble the frame.
1. Fit a "typical" blade - 1/2" resaw - track and tension. Remove the upper blade guides and loosen the lower blade guides so that the blade is free.
1. Check the side-to-side parallelism between the guidepost and the blade.
1. Shim the riser block to bring the blade parallel to the guidepost.
1. Set the table perpendicular to the blade/guidepost and adjust the stop.
1. Check the parallelism between the back of the blade and the guidepost. Adjust by shimming the wheels - while attempting to make / keep the wheels coplanar. Favor parallelism.
1. Shim the table trunions to set the table square to the back of the blade.

### Setting Blade Tension

[Tension Bandsaws Without a Gauge - FWW #230](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2012/10/25/tension-bandsaws-without-a-gauge) - With the upper blade guide all the way up tension on a 1/2" or smaller blade can be judged by pressing the blade sideways – – a deflection of about 1/4" (without turning your fingertip white) is about right.

A torque wrench on a Carter Ratchet-Rod seems like it would provide a way to calculate blade tension (or it would provide a way to consistantly set tension.

### Squaring Table To The Blade (setting the stop and shimming the trunions)

From Michael Fortune ([FWW: Squaring Your Bandsaw Table](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2011/05/24/squaring-your-bandsaw-table)):

Replace the 90° table stop with a piece of threaded rod, set the rod so that the table can tilt to the left far enough to hit the frame of the  saw, then cap the rod with a length of brass rod drilled out to form a cap for the threaded rod with enough "padding" at the top to bring the top back to approximately level (without reaching down to the lock nut), adjust to square and lock the threaded rod in place. Now you can maintain the squareness of the table when you tilt it to the left.

### Controling Drift / Setting Miter Slot To The Blade

According to Michael Fortune ([FWW #270 Two Fixes for Bandsaw Drift](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2018/07/16/two-fixes-for-bandsaw-drift)) a bandsaw should not have any drift – both because it can be easily (and he says permenantly) tuned out, and because blade drift means that you can't build jigs that depend on the miter slot or the repeatability of fence positions.

Using a sharp blade:

1. Adjust tracking so that the blade runs on the center of the upper wheel (this should make it parallel to the axis of the wheel).
1. Adjust the rip fence so that it is parallel to the miter slot on the table.
1. Loosen the trunion mounting bolts so thot the table position can be set os that the miter slot is parallels to the blade (and the axis of the upper wheel). Then, tighten the easily accessible bolts to hold the table in place as you make your test cuts.
1. Make a test cut:
   - If the cut drifts and pulls the work away from the fence (to the right): adjust the table clockwise (moving the back of the table towards the right).
   - If the cut does not drift away, check the position of the back of the blade in the kerf - it should be an even distance from both sides. If it is tighter on the left, towards the fence, adjust the table counter-clockwise (move the back of the table to the left, towards the frame of the saw).
1. Repeat until the saw blade runs true down the center of the kerf and the edge of the workpiece runs tight along the fence.

Another way to read the drift of the blade is by burning on the work. The blade is tight on the side that is burned.
   
Note: If the blade is **not** tracking on the center of the wheel, then it will drift to the right if it is too far forward, and to the left if it is too far to the back.

## Dust Collection

1. Piece of PVC or ABS pipe right below the lower blade guides attached to a vacuum or dust collector.

1. Second dust collection port in the lower housing as the blade turns up at about 7:30.
