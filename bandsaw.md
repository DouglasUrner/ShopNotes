### Controling Drift / Setting Table

According to Michael Fortune [FWW #270 Two Fixes for Bandsaw Drift](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2018/07/16/two-fixes-for-bandsaw-drift) a bandsaw should not have any drift – both because it can be easily (and he says permenantly) tuned out, and because blade drift means that you can't build jigs that depend on the miter slot or the repeatability of fence positions.

Using a sharp blade:

1. Adjust tracking so that the blade runs on the center of the upper wheel (this should make it parallel to the axis of the wheel).
1. Adjust the rip fence so that it is parallel to the miter slot on the table.
1. Loosen the trunion mounting bolts so thot the table position can be set os that the miter slot is parallels to the blade (and the axis of the upper wheel). Then, tighten the easily accessible bolts to hold the table in place as you make your test cuts.
1. Make a test cut:
   - If the cut drifts and pulls the work away from the fence (to the right):
   - If the cut does not drift away, check the position of the back of the blade in the kerf - it should be an even distance from both sides. If it is tighter on the left, towards the fence, adjust the table
