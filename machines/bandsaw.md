### Mods

* Carter Tension Quick Release & Ratchet Rod
* Ittura Blade Guard Hand Screws
* Ittura Tracking Knob
* Kreg Micro-adjustable Fence with resaw guide
* Iturra Lower Wheel Brush

The Jet tension spring measures 2 1/4" and appears to be collapsed (it does not reach to the 1/8" blade tension mark even when fully released). An Iturra high tension spring for a Jet 14" bandsaw is 3" long - which means that it reaches all the way to the bottom of the tension/tracking assembly. However, there does not appear to be enough "space" in the spring to allow it to develop full tension on the scale for a 3/4" blade. It also does not allow the blade tension to be fully released when changing blades when it is used with an Iturra nut.

## Blades

[Essential Bandsaw Blades – Roland Johnson, FWW #252, 2016](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2015/12/02/essential-bandsaw-blades) – [PDF of full article](https://www.finewoodworking.com/membership/pdf/20025/011252052.pdf) – recommends:

* 1/4" 10 TPI regular tooth – scroll work and thin stock
* 3/8" 6 TPI hook tooth – general purpose
* 1/2" 3 TPI hook tooth – ripping & resawing

The limiting factor on blades for a 14" saw is the ablility of the saw frame to tension the blade and the blade's tolerance for flexing as it runs around the wheels. Most 3/4" blades are too thick to be properlly tensioned. The **Woodslicer** "family" of blades is an exception.

### Resawing

1/2" or 3/4" 2/3 (Timberwolf) or 3/4 (Woodslicer/Bladerunner) variable tooth - with large gullets for chip room.

* Woodslicer (Highland Hardware) - a 0.022" narrow kerf (1/32" / 0.8 mm) resaw blade with very good reviews. Many reports of the blade dulling quickly if you hit nails or knots. The narrow kerf conserves wood and helps to keep the blade running straight – but it also makes it unsuitable for green wood and less able to cut curves than a blade with a "standard" amount of set. Blades with similar specs:

  * **Bladerunner** (Iturra Design branded Woodslicer) - available in 1/2" and 3/4" widths.
  * [KERFMaster](http://www.spectrumsupply.com/kerfmaster-2.aspx) (Spectrum Supply) - specs seem similar, but no claim that they are the same blade. Available in a 5/8" width and a narrow blade made from 0.016" stock – as well as 1/2", 5/8", and 3/4" in 0.022" thickness.
  * [Infinity Rip Bandsaw Blades](https://www.infinitytools.com/saw-blades-accessories/bandsaw-blades-machines-accessories/band-saw-blades/infinity-rip-bandsaw-blades) - available in 5/8" and 3/4" widths.

* [Timberwolf](http://timberwolfblades.com/Blade-Selector.php#5) - 1/2" or 3/4" 2/3 VPC (variable pitch hook pattern) 0.025" - 5 tooth raker

* [Laguna Resaw King](https://lagunatools.com/accessories/bandsaw-accessories/bandsaw-blades/resaw-king-bandsaw-blade/) (carbide) 2-3 variable pitch, 1.1 mm (0.041") kerf, Laugna claims that the blade can be resharpend 4 or 5 times. Available in 1/2″, 3/4″, 1″, 1.25″, and 2″ widths.

## Bandsaw Set Up

The goal is to have a saw that cuts true, parallel to the miter slot, and that allows moving the guidepost to accomodate stock thickness without the need for adjusting the guides – this means having the blade and guidepost parallel.

1. If using a riser block - clean / remove paint from the faces of the riser block and the frame halves.
1. Assemble the frame.
1. Fit a "typical" blade - 1/2" resaw - track and tension. Remove the upper blade guides and loosen the lower blade guides so that the blade is free.
1. Check the side-to-side parallelism between the guidepost and the blade.
1. Shim the frame/riser block to bring the blade parallel to the guidepost.
1. Set the table perpendicular to the blade/guidepost (the blade wins if there is a difference) and adjust the stop.
1. Check the parallelism between the back of the blade and the guidepost. Adjust by shimming the wheels - while attempting to make / keep the wheels coplanar. Favor parallelism.
1. Shim the table trunions to set the table square to the back of the blade.

## Troubleshooting

### Tuning

1. **Tracking** - Alex Snodgrass (Carter) says to run the gullets at the center of the upper wheel. Michael Fortune says to center the blade on the upper wheel. My current theory is to get the blade stable somewhere around the center of the wheel and then to fine tune until the blade is parallel to the mitre slot (actually, so that the cut runs parallel to the slot). To check the blade alignment you can place a straight edge on the blade so that it passes between the teeth. Or use a fancy tool.
1. **Squaring the blade to the table** - With a tall and square piece of stock, make a short resaw cut then reverse the stock to check that the blade still aligns with the first cut.

### Setting Blade Tension

[Tension Bandsaws Without a Gauge - FWW #230](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2012/10/25/tension-bandsaws-without-a-gauge) - With the upper blade guide all the way up tension on a 1/2" or smaller blade can be judged by pressing the blade sideways – – a deflection of about 1/4" (without turning your fingertip white) is about right.

Highland Hardware [describes the process](https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/library/Slicing%20Wood.pdf) like this "Install the Wood Slicer on your saw, with lateral guides and thrust bearings opened up and backed off both above and below the table so they do not contact the blade. Crank on some tension, and then give the blade a sharp sideways poke about halfway between the upper and lower wheels. The blade will deflect a short distance and then seem to hit a wall; if you push a lot harder it will bend farther, but there's a fairly distinct point where it quits deflecting easily. Add tension until this sideways movement is just 1/4" to 5/16" (7 mm) on saws with 6" (150 mm) depth of cut, or about 3/8" (10 mm) on saws with 12" (300 mm) depth."

They go on to suggest fine tuning the tension by "Before you bring the lateral guides and thrust bearings up close to the blade, close the wheel covers and turn the saw on. If vibration blurs the blade, try increasing or decreasing the tension very slightly until the blade runs smoothly in a straight, quiet line from wheel to wheel. Cuts will be smoother when you eliminate this source of fluttering in the kerf, and the saw will run quieter and more efficiently as well."

A torque wrench on a Carter Ratchet-Rod seems like it would provide a way to calculate blade tension (or would, at least, provide a way to consistantly set tension).

### Squaring Table To The Blade (setting the stop and shimming the trunions)

From Michael Fortune ([FWW: Squaring Your Bandsaw Table](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2011/05/24/squaring-your-bandsaw-table)):

Replace the 90° table stop with a piece of threaded rod, set the rod so that the table can tilt to the left far enough to hit the frame of the  saw, then cap the rod with a length of brass rod drilled out to form a cap for the threaded rod with enough "padding" at the top to bring the top back to approximately level (without reaching down to the lock nut), adjust to square and lock the threaded rod in place. Now you can maintain the squareness of the table when you tilt it to the left.

### Controling Drift / Setting Miter Slot To The Blade

According to Michael Fortune ([FWW #270 Two Fixes for Bandsaw Drift](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2018/07/16/two-fixes-for-bandsaw-drift)) a bandsaw should not have any drift – both because it can be easily (and he says permenantly) tuned out, and because blade drift means that you can't build jigs that depend on the miter slot or the repeatability of fence positions.

Using a sharp blade:

1. Adjust tracking so that the blade runs on the center of the upper wheel (this should make it parallel to the axis of the wheel).
1. Adjust the rip fence so that it is parallel to the miter slot on the table.
1. Loosen the trunion mounting bolts so thot the table position can be set os that the miter slot is parallels to the blade (and the axis of the upper wheel). Then, tighten the easily accessible bolts to hold the table in place as you make your test cuts.
1. Make a test cut:
   - If the cut drifts and pulls the work away from the fence (to the right): adjust the table clockwise (moving the back of the table towards the right).
   - If the cut does not drift away, check the position of the back of the blade in the kerf - it should be an even distance from both sides. If it is tighter on the left, towards the fence, adjust the table counter-clockwise (move the back of the table to the left, towards the frame of the saw).
1. Repeat until the saw blade runs true down the center of the kerf and the edge of the workpiece runs tight along the fence.

Another way to read the drift of the blade is by burning on the work. The blade is tight on the side that is burned.
   
Note: If the blade is **not** tracking on the center of the wheel, then it will drift to the right if it is too far forward, and to the left if it is too far to the back.

## Dust Collection

1. Piece of PVC or ABS pipe right below the lower blade guides attached to a vacuum or dust collector.

1. Second dust collection port in the lower housing as the blade turns up at about 7:30.

### Curves (followers)

A "pin" follows a template attached to the work. The resulting piece is slightly oversized and is usually trimmed on a table mounted router with a pattern bit.
