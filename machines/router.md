Sides are machined vertically with the inside face against the fence. The front and back are machined laying flat on the table with the inside face down (against the table). Bit height is the same for both cuts. The fence is adjusted between the sides and the front/back. For safety and efficiency machine sheet materials before cutting the individual pieces.

There are two ways to machine the front and back: *blind,* where the face of the front (or back) covers the endgrain of the sides, and *through* where the endgrain is exposed. For through joints only one stock thickness is possible (roughly the cutting height (CH).

* **Jeseda 855-512**  
Cuts a 10.5 mm through joint. For 12 mm stock setting the cutter to take exactly the depth of the stock (maybe leaving < 0.1 mm) and taking two passes with the second on a shim of about 0.7 mm (the cardboard backing from a legal pad) without changing the exposure of the bit produces a nicely fitting through joint. Jeseda is out of business and the Infinity 55-512 bit does not appear to be a replacement. 
* CMT: 855.502.11 & 855.508.11 - [CMT instructions](https://www.cmtorangetools.com/downloads/5716/273/143_352_how_to_make_drawers.pdf) (photos are too small and/or out of focus)  
* Infinity: 55-512, 1 3/4" CD, 1/2" CH, < 18,000 rpm - [Infinity instructions (download)](https://www.infinitytools.com/fileuploader/download/download/?d=0&file=custom%2Fupload%2FFile-1443023036.pdf)  
Looking at the Infinity catalog, it appears that this bit will cut a through joint in 12.7 mm stock.
* Whiteside: 3347, 1" / 3/4" CD (large/small diameters), 17/32" CH, 5/16" minimum vertical depth of cut, < 18,000 rpm - [Whiteside instructions from Highland Woodworking](https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/library/manuals/whiteside/WhitesideDrawerLockInstructions.pdf)

**Setup:** 
**Sides:** align the lower (smaller) diameter of the cutter with the face of the fence. Set the height of the bit so that the top of the cutter is at one-half of the stock thickness above the table.  
**Front & Back (flush):** align the fence so that the exposure of the larger (upper) diameter of the cutter is equal to the side stock thickness.  
**Front (overlapping):** move the fence back from the back (flush) postion by the amount of the overlap.

Make a setup block. Use spacers to set bit exposure when switching between sides and the front/back (Pat Warner's method).

CMT's drawings look like bit height should be set at 12mm with the measuring point for each half of the cut at the mid-point on the slope.

**Troubleshooting:**  

#### Lock Miter Bits

[Peter Parfit: How to make a lock mitre joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtTAJO1Paj0) - works well in MDF. Explains cutter geometry and setup well. Align bit centerlines with 1/2 stock thickness above table and exposed beyond fence. Easier with setup blocks.
