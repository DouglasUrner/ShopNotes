# Routers, Bits, and Tooling

**General Bit Speed Recommendations:**

In general: bigger == slower. When in doubt use the slowest speed available.
 
| Bit Diameter            | **Maximum** RPM |  Tip Speed (m/min) |
|                    ---: |            ---: |               ---: |
| Up to 25 mm (1")        |          24,000 |              1,884 |
| 25 - 50 mm (1 - 2")	    |          18,000 |              2,826 |
| 50 - 63 mm (2 - 2.5")	  |          16,000 |              3,165 |
| 63 - 83 mm (2.5 - 3.5")	|          12,000 |              3,127 |

Maximum speeds are probably set to limit tip speeds as bits get big. For smaller bits the maximum speed of the router and the speed steps where they are not infinitely variable may be the limit. You would expect that since larger bits have more mass and are likely to be harder on bearings than smaller bits their upper limit would be lower rather than higher.
