**[Incra Mast-R-Lift II](https://www.incrementaltools.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=INCRA-Mast-R-Lift-II)**  
A modifided version of the Jess-em Mast-R-Lift II that uses magnetic plates rather than twist in plates and a cam to lock the plate into postion in the table port. Metric and inch scales available. The Incra plates are available in solid (standard) and preforated (accessory) for dust collection. According to Incra, the standard plates sometimes do a better job than the Clean Sweep plates depending on the type of chip being produced. There is also a solid plate for when the router is not in use. [Manual](https://incra.com/manuals/INCRA_Mast-R-Lift-II_Metric.pdf)

**[Jess-em Mast-R-Lift II](https://jessem.com/collections/router-lifts-and-plates/products/mast-r-lift-ii)**  
The most significant difference between the Jess-em and Incra branded Mast-R-Lift II lifts are the plates. Jess-em uses a phenolic twist in plate. Adapts to a wide range of motor diameters. Metric and inch scales available. Incra makes a kit to convert to their magnetic plates (it is spendy, about $130 (Jan 2019)).

**[Jess-em Rout-R-Lift II](https://jessem.com/collections/router-lifts-and-plates/products/rout-r-lift-ii-model)**  
This as a less expensive version of the Mast-R-Lift II intended for smaller routers (e.g., the Porter Cable 690). It has a phenolic top and comes in versions that are specific to the router motor diameter.
