For making bushing guided cuts on a router table. Uses an Ikea plastic cutting board as a base (10 mm thick x 28 cm x 43 cm).

### Pattern Routing

#### Making Templates

Materials:
* 1/2 MDF
* Ikea cutting boards

### Jointing

#### On a router table

Set up router with a 3/4" bottom (top on router table) or top and bottom piloted bit and make it a more or less permanant set up for edge jointing narrow stock and pattern work. Top and bottom pilots would make it easy to flip part (assuming that it is taped to pattern) to handle grain reversals. Set up with a plate the thickness of the bearing so that the changeover only requires removing or adding the plate.

Simple jig from a piece of MDF. Build jig(s) to take easy to work with cuts - e.g., 1 mm. Each jig can have two sides with a different cut on each side (0.5 mm and 1 mm or 1 mm and 2 mm).

#### With an edge guide

**[How to Joint Two Boards at Once with Your Router](https://www.popularwoodworking.com/editors-blog/how-to-joint-two-boards-at-once-with-your-router/)**  
Clamp boards with the edges to be jointed facing each other and spaced so that a router bit will trim about 0.5 to 1 mm from both boards at once - as if you were cutting a dado. Clamp an edge guide to one of the boards so that it will guide the router down the center of the gap between the boards. Any deviation of the router bit or bow in the guide should be mirrored on the other board resulting in a perfect fit.

Comments on the article suggest not using (or removing) the spacers as they could "spring" the boards and result in a bad fit. In no case should more than two be used (if three fit, either the edge is already good or the board is sprung).
