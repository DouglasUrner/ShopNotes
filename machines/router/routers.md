### Festool

Each Festool router is unique - in general accessories can not be shared between them.

Festool USA switched to imperial measure scales around 2016 - the only change on the routers is the plunge depth scale. The metric part is available gratis from Festool.

**Speed Control:** 10,000 - 23,000 RPM (continuously variable)

The speed control dial is marked 1-6. Festool does not publish a mapping between the dial markings and the actual speeds (though presumably 1 is 10,000 and 6 is 23,000). They do publish recommended settings for bit size and materials:

| Material  | 3-14 mm | 15-25 mm | 26-35 mm |
| :---      | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hardwood  | 6-4 | 5-3 | 3-1 |
| Softwood  | 6-5 | 6-3 | 4-1 |
| Sheet Goods | 6-5 | 6-3 | 4-2 |
| Plastic   | 6-4 | 5-3 | 2-1 |
| Aluminium | 3-1 | 2-1 | 1 |

Collets: 1/4 and 8 mm
