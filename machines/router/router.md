#### Drawer Lock

Sides are machined vertically with the inside face against the fence. The front and back are machined laying flat on the table with the inside face down (against the table). Bit height is the same for both cuts. The fence is adjusted between the sides and the front/back. For safety and efficiency machine sheet materials before cutting the individual pieces.

There are two ways to machine the front and back: *blind,* where the face of the front (or back) covers the endgrain of the sides, and *through* where the endgrain is exposed. For through joints only one stock thickness is possible (roughly the cutting height (CH).

The bit can also be used - at full exposure - to cut drawer slides.

* **Jeseda 855-512**  
Cuts a 10.5 mm through joint. For 12 mm stock setting the cutter to take exactly the depth of the stock (maybe leaving < 0.1 mm) and taking two passes with the second on a shim of about 0.7 mm (the cardboard backing from a legal pad) without changing the exposure of the bit produces a nicely fitting through joint. Jeseda is out of business and the Infinity 55-512 bit does not appear to be a replacement.

Looking at the Infinity catalog, it appears that this bit will cut a through joint in 12.7 mm stock.

**Setup:** 
**Sides:** align the lower (smaller) diameter of the cutter with the face of the fence. Set the height of the bit so that the top of the cutter is at one-half of the stock thickness above the table.  
**Front & Back (flush):** align the fence so that the exposure of the larger (upper) diameter of the cutter is equal to the side stock thickness.  
**Front (overlapping):** move the fence back from the back (flush) postion by the amount of the overlap.

Make a setup block. Use spacers to set bit exposure when switching between sides and the front/back (Pat Warner's method).

CMT's drawings look like bit height should be set at 12mm with the measuring point for each half of the cut at the mid-point on the slope.

**Troubleshooting:**  

#### Lock Miter Bits

[Peter Parfit: How to make a lock mitre joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtTAJO1Paj0) - works well in MDF. Explains cutter geometry and setup well. Align bit centerlines with 1/2 stock thickness above table and exposed beyond fence. Easier with setup blocks.

For making bushing guided cuts on a router table. Uses an Ikea plastic cutting board as a base (10 mm thick x 28 cm x 43 cm).

### Pattern Routing

Materials:
* 1/2 MDF
* Ikea cutting boards

### Jointing

#### On a router table

Set up router with a 3/4" bottom (top on router table) or top and bottom piloted bit and make it a more or less permanant set up for edge jointing narrow stock and pattern work. Top and bottom pilots would make it easy to flip part (assuming that it is taped to pattern) to handle grain reversals. Set up with a plate the thickness of the bearing so that the changeover only requires removing or adding the plate.

[Jointing Edges at the Router Table](https://atelierdubricoleur.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/cd-storage-cabinet-1-armoire-range-cd/) - an aside to a post about building a CD cabinet. Simple jig from a piece of MDF. Build jig(s) to take easy to work with cuts - e.g., 1 mm. Each jig can have two sides with a different cut on each side (0.5 mm and 1 mm or 1 mm and 2 mm).

#### With an edge guide

**[How to Joint Two Boards at Once with Your Router](https://www.popularwoodworking.com/editors-blog/how-to-joint-two-boards-at-once-with-your-router/)**  
Clamp boards with the edges to be jointed facing each other and spaced so that a router bit will trim about 0.5 to 1 mm from both boards at once - as if you were cutting a dado. Clamp an edge guide to one of the boards so that it will guide the router down the center of the gap between the boards. Any deviation of the router bit or bow in the guide should be mirrored on the other board resulting in a perfect fit.

Comments on the article suggest not using (or removing) the spacers as they could "spring" the boards and result in a bad fit. In no case should more than two be used (if three fit, either the edge is already good or the board is sprung).

#### Router Lifts

**[Incra Mast-R-Lift II](https://www.incrementaltools.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=INCRA-Mast-R-Lift-II)**  
A modifided version of the Jess-em Mast-R-Lift II that uses magnetic plates rather than twist in plates and a cam to lock the plate into postion in the table port. Metric and inch scales available. The Incra plates are available in solid (standard) and preforated (accessory) for dust collection. According to Incra, the standard plates sometimes do a better job than the Clean Sweep plates depending on the type of chip being produced. There is also a solid plate for when the router is not in use. [Manual](https://incra.com/manuals/INCRA_Mast-R-Lift-II_Metric.pdf)

**[Jess-em Mast-R-Lift II](https://jessem.com/collections/router-lifts-and-plates/products/mast-r-lift-ii)**  
The most significant difference between the Jess-em and Incra branded Mast-R-Lift II lifts are the plates. Jess-em uses a phenolic twist in plate. Adapts to a wide range of motor diameters. Metric and inch scales available. Incra makes a kit to convert to their magnetic plates (it is spendy, about $130 (Jan 2019)).

**[Jess-em Rout-R-Lift II](https://jessem.com/collections/router-lifts-and-plates/products/rout-r-lift-ii-model)**  
This as a less expensive version of the Mast-R-Lift II intended for smaller routers (e.g., the Porter Cable 690). It has a phenolic top and comes in versions that are specific to the router motor diameter.

**[Woodpeckers Precision Router Lift V2](https://www.woodpeck.com/routing/router-lifts-plates/prl-v2-precision-router-lift.html)**  
Different versions depending on the diameter of the router moter. Can be converted. Inch scale only.
