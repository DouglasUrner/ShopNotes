For making bushing guided cuts on a router table. Uses an Ikea plastic cutting board as a base (10 mm thick x 28 cm x 43 cm).

### Pattern Routing

#### Making Templates

Materials:
* 1/2 MDF
* Ikea cutting boards

### Jointing

#### On a router table

Set up router with a 3/4" bottom (top on router table) or top and bottom piloted bit and make it a more or less permanant set up for edge jointing narrow stock and pattern work. Top and bottom pilots would make it easy to flip part (assuming that it is taped to pattern) to handle grain reversals. Set up with a plate the thickness of the bearing so that the changeover only requires removing or adding the plate.

[Jointing Edges at the Router Table](https://atelierdubricoleur.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/cd-storage-cabinet-1-armoire-range-cd/) - an aside to a post about building a CD cabinet. Simple jig from a piece of MDF. Build jig(s) to take easy to work with cuts - e.g., 1 mm. Each jig can have two sides with a different cut on each side (0.5 mm and 1 mm or 1 mm and 2 mm).

#### With an edge guide

**[How to Joint Two Boards at Once with Your Router](https://www.popularwoodworking.com/editors-blog/how-to-joint-two-boards-at-once-with-your-router/)**  
Clamp boards with the edges to be jointed facing each other and spaced so that a router bit will trim about 0.5 to 1 mm from both boards at once - as if you were cutting a dado. Clamp an edge guide to one of the boards so that it will guide the router down the center of the gap between the boards. Any deviation of the router bit or bow in the guide should be mirrored on the other board resulting in a perfect fit.

Comments on the article suggest not using (or removing) the spacers as they could "spring" the boards and result in a bad fit. In no case should more than two be used (if three fit, either the edge is already good or the board is sprung).

#### Router Lifts

**[Incra Mast-R-Lift II](https://www.incrementaltools.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=INCRA-Mast-R-Lift-II)**  
A modifided version of the Jess-em Mast-R-Lift II that uses magnetic plates rather than twist in plates and a cam to lock the plate into postion in the table port. Metric and inch scales available. The Incra plates are available in solid (standard) and preforated (accessory) for dust collection. According to Incra, the standard plates sometimes do a better job than the Clean Sweep plates depending on the type of chip being produced. There is also a solid plate for when the router is not in use. [Manual](https://incra.com/manuals/INCRA_Mast-R-Lift-II_Metric.pdf)

**[Jess-em Mast-R-Lift II](https://jessem.com/collections/router-lifts-and-plates/products/mast-r-lift-ii)**  
The most significant difference between the Jess-em and Incra branded Mast-R-Lift II lifts are the plates. Jess-em uses a phenolic twist in plate. Adapts to a wide range of motor diameters. Metric and inch scales available. Incra makes a kit to convert to their magnetic plates (it is spendy, about $130 (Jan 2019)).

**[Jess-em Rout-R-Lift II](https://jessem.com/collections/router-lifts-and-plates/products/rout-r-lift-ii-model)**  
This as a less expensive version of the Mast-R-Lift II intended for smaller routers (e.g., the Porter Cable 690). It has a phenolic top and comes in versions that are specific to the router motor diameter.

**[Woodpeckers Precision Router Lift V2](https://www.woodpeck.com/routing/router-lifts-plates/prl-v2-precision-router-lift.html)**
