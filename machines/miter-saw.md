## Fences & Stops

Working with short cuts (within the length of the saw's intregal fence, before you hit the scale of an aftermarket fence). Considerations:

* Metric or Metric/Imperial scales on both sides of the blade.
* Relatively easy to set zero on the scales.
* Fence scale should be "direct reading" - the scale distance should directly correspond to the distance from the blade, it should not depend an a particular stop. This means that there is an area with no scale. Solve with a "short piece stop" that reads from an "artifical zero" - something like 500 mm so that conversions can easily be done in your head. Or maybe an auxillary "sub-fence" that has a scale and an adjustable stop that reaches all the way to the blade. It would have a left-to-right reading scale on the left hand side of the blade so that when it was extended fully and touching the blade it reads zero.

### Incra

Two track systems available in lengths up to 52":

* [Incra Track](https://incra.com/miter_gauges_accessories_incratracks.html) - Compatible with the (non-flip) [Incra Shop Stop](https://incra.com/miter_gauges_accessories_shopstop.html) ([manual](https://incra.com/manuals/Stop_web_use_only.pdf)). The fence is 1 3/4" tall, It can be mounted on a base to get greater height. [Incra Track Manual](https://incra.com/manuals/track.pdf)
* [Flip Fence](https://incra.com/miter_gauges_accessories_flipfence.html) - Fits the [Incra Flip Shop Stop](http://www.incrementaltools.com/Incremental_Flip_Shop_Stop_Positioner_p/flipshopstop.htm) ([manual](https://incra.com/manuals/flip_shopstop_manual.pdf)), but not the Shop Stop. There is no obvious way to set stops close to the blade. A [telescoping version](https://incra.com/miter_gauges_accessories_telescoping_flipfence.html) is also available.
