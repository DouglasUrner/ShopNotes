## Pattern Tracing

A "pin" follows a template attached to the work. The resulting piece is slightly oversized and is usually trimmed on a table mounted router with a pattern bit.

Bottom pattern jigs are simpler, but top pattern jigs make it easier to maneuver the pattern to follow the pin.

### Bottom Pattern

Blade guide mounted vs. free standing: for top pattern jigs, blade mounted guides make for easier adjustment and leave the table clear of obstructions.

Finger vs. pin: in a finger jig the pattern is guided by a finger that surrounds the blade providing a contact surface in front of and behind the blade, pin jigs only provide a guide in front of the blade.

The effective width of the blade, for determining the radius of curves in the pattern is determined by the size and position of the finger or pin(s).
