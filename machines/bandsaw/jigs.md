# Bandsaw Jigs

## Pattern Tracing

A "pin" follows a template attached to the work. The resulting piece is slightly oversized and is usually trimmed on a table mounted router with a pattern bit.

Bottom pattern jigs are simpler, but top pattern jigs make it easier to maneuver the pattern to follow the pin.
