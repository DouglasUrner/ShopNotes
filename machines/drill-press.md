* T-tracks for fence adjustment.
* Work clamping options.
  - MFT grid

### Design Ideas

[Ronald Walters: Drill Press Table](https://woodgears.ca/reader/walters/drillpress_table.html) - lots of nice ideas: round off-center sacrificial block, rotates to get you a clean backing and by being off-center it will not spin; extended controls; filler strips to keep t-tracks from filling with debris.

[Woodsmith Plan: Woodworking Drill Press Table](https://www.woodsmithplans.com/plan/woodworking-drill-press-table/) - dust collection, clamping slots & filler blocks.

[Drill Press Table](https://www.woodsmithplans.com/plan/drill-press-table/) - miter gear brings height adjustment to the front of the table.

[Drill Press Table With A Twist]() - move the height adjustment crank to the front of the table using a pair of [miter gears](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NYAFLS) to turn and extend the shaft. An extension brings out the table lock. Based on the WoodSmith plans above.
