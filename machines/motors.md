# Motor Information

## Decoding Sizing Information

## Variable Frequency Drives - VFD

Controllers are available with single-phase AC inputs and three-phase AC outputs.

**Discussion of drill press conversion on Practical Machinist: [VFD for drill press?](https://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/transformers-phase-converters-and-vfd/vfd-drill-press-173410/)**  
Takeaways:
* When a motor is cooled by an intregal fan, slowing the motor reduces cooling.
* Drill presses "loaf" most of the time, so cooling the motor may not be *too* much of a concern.
* Pick pulleys to get about 700 RPM at 60 Hz.
* Reducing speed also reduces power, so there is value in keeping the pulley system (and in a larger motor).
* Hitachi, TECO, and AC Tech make well regarded drives.
* There are "inverter duty" and "sensorless vector" motors that are designed for VFD service - may not be necessary in a drill press application for occasional duty.
