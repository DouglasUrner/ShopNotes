# Clamps

## Cauls

**Machining cauls:**  

Use relatively straight and knot free construction lumber. Then:

1. Cut to the desired length. Allow extra at the ends for threaded rod for clamping the cauls.
1. Dress both edges.
1. Space the ends of the pair of cauls about 6 mm apart (for 600 mm cauls, so 1:100) with small blocks and screw them together in the middle.
1. Joint or straight line rip the outside edges.
1. Separate the pair.
1. Apply packing tape on the curved edges.
