## Drawers

### Slides

#### Blum Tandem

* Setback:
  - Inset: thickness of the front panel of the drawer box + the thickness of the drawer face - 10 mm. Drawer faces will be recessed 0.5 mm and can be adjusted outward.

#### Blum Movento 769 & 763H

* Setback:
  - Inset **with depth adjuster**: thickness of the front panel of the drawer box + the thickness of the drawer face - 9.5 mm. Drawer faces will be recessed 0.5 mm and can be adjusted outward.
  - Inset **without depth adjuster**: thickness of the front panel of the drawer box + the thickness of the drawer face - 13 mm. Drawer faces will be flush with the front of the case and cannot be adjusted.

### Inset Drawer Faces

* Reveals 1.5-2.0 mm (cases need to have straight sides and be square to 1 mm on the diagonals).
* Size bottom faces and single drawer faces to the drawer space minus 2x the reveal.
* Size the remaining faces to the drawer space minus 1x the reveal. This should produce a drawer face that aligns with the bottom of the slide.
