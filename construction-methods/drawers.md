* Machine cut sliding dovetails - use a 3/8" bit in 1/2" stock (a Whiteside D8-375x8 for example). Trim the long edges to height after cutting the dovetails to clean up the blowout from the router bit.
* Hand cut traditional dovetails
* Drawerlock joint - works in solid and good plywood drawers.
* Rabbets and brads
